K-Means Clustering
==================
K-means works in any dimension, but is most fun to demonstrate in two, because we can plot pictures.
Lets make some data with clusters. We do this by shifting the means of the points around.
```{r}
set.seed(101)
x=matrix(rnorm(100*2),100,2)
xmean=matrix(rnorm(8, sd=4),4,2)
which=sample(1:4, 100, replace=TRUE)
x=x+xmean[which,]
plot(x, col=which, pch=19)
```
We know the "true" cluster IDs, but we wont tell that to the 'kmeans' algorithm.
```{r}
km.out=kmeans(x, 4, nstart=15)
km.out
plot(x, col=km.out$cluster, cex=2, pch=1, lwd=2)
points(x, col=which, pch=19)
points(x, col=c(4,3,2,1)[which], pch=19)
```
